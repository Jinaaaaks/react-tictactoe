# Tic Tac Toe – React Edition 🎮

My first React project: a simple and clean implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- `useState` for managing player turns and board state
- Conditional rendering for game status
- Component-based structure (Board, Square, etc.)
- Handling reset and win logic

## 🎨 Design

- Dark mode UI  
- Clean layout with hover feedback  
- Responsive and lightweight

## 🐛 Debug Moments

- A stubborn state update issue that taught me how re-renders work 😅
- Edge cases like draw detection and disabling clicked squares

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- React (Vite or Create React App)  
- CSS (or Tailwind if you used it)  
- Basic JavaScript logic

## 🧪 How to Run

```bash
npm install
npm start
